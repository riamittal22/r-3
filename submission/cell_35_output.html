<p>Can you summarize the news from the past two weeks in a casual tone?</p>
<p>Retrieved 5 documents</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<pre><code> Sure! Here&#39;s a casual rundown of the news from the past two weeks based on the articles:</code></pre>
<p>First up, in the finance world, there&#39;s been quite an oops moment—markets are worried about a potential meltdown. The global investment scene is shifting, and on Wall Street, traders aren&#39;t expecting a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this December anymore. The chances of a cut have noticeably decreased, which has rattled some investors (Article: &quot;Financial markets meltdown fears spread as US interest rate cut hopes fade&quot; from ABC News Australia).</p>
<p>On the tech side, there&#39;s some surprisingly upbeat news. Venture capital funding for crypto startups is bouncing back after hitting multi-year lows late last year. Investors are feeling more bullish about web3 projects now, and a couple of crypto firms just raised big bucks—one even got $450 million! This signals a possible renewed interest in the crypto sector after a rough patch (Article: &quot;$450M for Noname, two billion-dollar rounds, and good news for crypto startups | TechCrunch&quot;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, not everything is smooth sailing. The article from Ars Technica highlights how AI technology is being used to turn some pretty gross, repetitive texts into interesting podcasts—definitely a strange but funny example of AI&#39;s versatility.</p>
<p>On the political front, cartoonists across the country are sharing their takes on recent political antics, memes, and hypocrisies—which is always a lively way to see the week&#39;s political highlights (Article: &quot;The nation’s cartoonists on the week in politics&quot; from Politico).</p>
<p>Lastly, there&#39;s a bit of a scientific or medical legal story involving a Chicago-based lab co-owner who pleaded guilty to a COVID testing scam, which brought in millions. That&#39;s a reminder of some ongoing issues around health testing scams.</p>
<p>And over at the awards and entertainment world, the Golden Globes nominations came out. &#39;One Battle After Another&#39; led the nominations with nine, which was a bit of a surprise, and there were some favorites left out.</p>
<p>All in all, it&#39;s been a mix of economic shifts, tech bounce-backs, political commentary, and some odd AI experiments. Quite the two weeks!</p>

    &quot;question&quot;: &quot;Can you summarize the news from the past two weeks in a casual tone?&quot;,<br/>
    &quot;response&quot;: &quot;Sure! Here&#39;s a casual rundown of the news from the past two weeks based on the articles:\n\nFirst up, in the finance world, there&#39;s been quite an oops moment—markets are worried about a potential meltdown. The global investment scene is shifting, and on Wall Street, traders aren&#39;t expecting a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this December anymore. The chances of a cut have noticeably decreased, which has rattled some investors (Article: \&quot;Financial markets meltdown fears spread as US interest rate cut hopes fade\&quot; from ABC News Australia).\n\nOn the tech side, there&#39;s some surprisingly upbeat news. Venture capital funding for crypto startups is bouncing back after hitting multi-year lows late last year. Investors are feeling more bullish about web3 projects now, and a couple of crypto firms just raised big bucks—one even got $450 million! This signals a possible renewed interest in the crypto sector after a rough patch (Article: \&quot;$450M for Noname, two billion-dollar rounds, and good news for crypto startups | TechCrunch\&quot;).\n\nMeanwhile, not everything is smooth sailing. The article from Ars Technica highlights how AI technology is being used to turn some pretty gross, repetitive texts into interesting podcasts—definitely a strange but funny example of AI&#39;s versatility.\n\nOn the political front, cartoonists across the country are sharing their takes on recent political antics, memes, and hypocrisies—which is always a lively way to see the week&#39;s political highlights (Article: \&quot;The nation’s cartoonists on the week in politics\&quot; from Politico).\n\nLastly, there&#39;s a bit of a scientific or medical legal story involving a Chicago-based lab co-owner who pleaded guilty to a COVID testing scam, which brought in millions. That&#39;s a reminder of some ongoing issues around health testing scams.\n\nAnd over at the awards and entertainment world, the Golden Globes nominations came out. &#39;One Battle After Another&#39; led the nominations with nine, which was a bit of a surprise, and there were some favorites left out.\n\nAll in all, it&#39;s been a mix of economic shifts, tech bounce-backs, political commentary, and some odd AI experiments. Quite the two weeks!&quot;,<br/>
